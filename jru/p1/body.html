<h3> Friends </h3>

A friend is someone we turn to
when our spirits need a lift.<br>
A friend is someone we treasure
for our friendship is a gift.<br>

A friend is someone who fills our lives
with beauty, joy, and grace.<br>

And makes the whole world we live in
a better and happier place.

Your talent is God's gift to you.

Love is patient, love is kind.
It does not envy, it does not boast,
it is not proud.<br>

It is not rude, it is not self-seeking,
 it is not easily angered, 
it keeps no record of wrongs.<br>
Love does not delight in evil
but rejoices with the truth.<br>

It always protects, always trusts,
always hopes, always perseveres.<br><br> - Anonymous -

Somewhere there's someone who dreams of your smile,<br>
and finds in your presence that life is worth while.<br>
So when you are lonely, remember it's true<br>
Somebody somewhere is thinking of you.<br>
